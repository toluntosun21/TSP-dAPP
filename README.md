# TSP-dAPP

This is a decentralized application which runs on Ethereum Blockchain. 

The application allows users to upload arbitrary length TSP(Traveling Salesman Problem) 
instances each having a prize for the best solution. 

Users, typically owning strong computational power, can also send solutions to the existing instances to compete for the prize. 

The guarantee of the agreement is provided by the Smart Contracts.
